        <p>Dear Ruby friends 🦊🐙🐹🐟,</p>

        <p>It's been a while since the last Amsterdam.rb event 👋</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Amsterdam-rb/events/283711435/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Please RSVP</a> so we have an idea of the audience we can expect, this February 22.</p>
        <p>The talks will be live streamed through YouTube (link to follow). No proprietary software is needed and no need to join.</p>
        <p>All attendees can talk and ask questions with the community and speakers on the Ruby Netherlands Slack. <a href="https://amsrbslack.herokuapp.com">Join our Slack today!</a></p>
        <p>With this being a virtual meetup, food and beverages will be of the "bring your own" kind. Grab a comfy chair and your favorite snacks and join us online!</p>

        <h3>Program</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc">
