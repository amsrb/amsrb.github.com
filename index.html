        <p>Well heck, Ruby friends,</p>

        <p>We miss conferencing with you all! That's why August 21 we'll host <a href="https://noruko.org/" target="_blank">#NoRuKo</a>, an online mini-conference! The name is a play on the biggest European Ruby Conference, "EuRuKo", which we organized last year, in Rotterdam. It's been quiet in the Ruby world in terms of online events, with a few (great!!) exceptions, but no more!</p>
        <p>Join for ~12 talks, quizzes, virtual #RubyKaraoke / #Quaraoke, and more: <a href="https://noruko.org/" target="_blank">noruko.org</a></p>
        <p>With this being a virtual event, food and beverages will be of the "bring your own" kind. Grab a comfy chair and your favorite snacks and join us online!</p>
        
        <p>See you on the interwebs!</p>
        <p>Arno, Floor, Tom &amp; Rayta</p>
