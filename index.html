        <p>Dear Ruby friends,</p>

        <p>We're doing this again! An exciting meetup where you can learn more about Ruby. Think you know the basics? Then let's dive deeper.</p>
        <p>We're excited to invite you for two inspiring talks, pizza and drinks. Sponsored and hosted by Catawiki (in their new office!) ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
        <p><strong>Program</strong></p>

        <p>18:00 Doors open üçª + üçï</p>
        <p>19:00 Jeff Kreeftmeijer - Metaclasses in Ruby</p>
        <p>19:30 Break</p>
        <p>20:00 TBA</p>
        <p>20:30-21:30 Networking and drinks</p>

        <p><strong>Talks</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Jeff Kreeftmeijer</strong> - Metaclasses in Ruby</p>
        <p>Jeff is a developer at AppSignal in Amsterdam. He's working with Ruby (and Elixir) on a daily basis and writes educational articles for the AppSignal's Ruby and Elixir newsletters.</p>
        <p>Through examining metaclasses, we'll learn how class and instance methods work in Ruby. Along the way, discover the difference between defining a method by passing an explicit "definee" and using <code>class << self</code> or <code>instance_eval</code>. Let's go!</p>
        <p>See you there &amp; bring a colleague! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

        <p>Arno, Floor, Tom &amp; Rayta</p>
