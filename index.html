        <p>Build a self-watering plant with the Ruby NL community!</p>
        <p>RSVP here to secure your spot: https://bit.ly/MakexRubyNL *Limited to Netherlands-based developers, 20 spots available</p>
        <p>Ruby NL and OfferZen have partnered up to offer a Make Event exclusively for the Ruby NL community.</p>
        <p><strong>"What is a Make Event?"</strong></p>
        <p>A space for curious developers to play, learn and build. During the event you will learn how to build a self-watering plant system using Arduino ESP8266.</p>
        <p>Due to the pace of the session, you need to be a software developer or have some coding experience (any language). You will be provided with full instructions and code samples, plus guidance from a Make Coach during the workshop to help you if you get stuck.<p>

        <p><strong>Event Requirements</strong></p>
        <p>All you need is a few hours and a computer (Mac/PC) with a USB port. A kit containing everything you will need (including soil, seeds and a pot) will be sent to your home before the event. The session will be hosted online via Zoom.</p>
        <p>And to get you excited, the kit also includes a t-shirt, some fun swag, plus a snack and drink to keep you energized throughout the 2 hours :)</p>
        <p>We promise you it's a lot of fun and a great chance to connect with some fellow developers and like-minded tech fans!</p>

        <p>RSVP closes 27 May or once capacity has been reached.</p>
