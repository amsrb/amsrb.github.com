        <p><strong>The Future of Rails 6: Scalable by Default</strong><br>
          We've all heard the phrase "Rails doesn't scale". Long running test suites and no standard
          for implementing multiple databases makes it hard to scale monolithic Rails applications.
          <br>
          Rails 6 will start making Rails scalable by default with parallel testing and improved
          support for using multiple databases. You'll no longer be forced to reinvent the wheel and
          create your own solution to these problems. In this talk we'll take a look why these
          improvements are important, how they work, and ways in which small ideas can quickly
          snowball into major changes.<br>
          This is just the beginning of Rails 6.
        </p>
