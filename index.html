        <p>Dear Ruby friends,</p>

        <p>
We're excited to invite you for two inspiring talks, pizza and drinks.</p>
        <p>Sponsored and hosted by WeTransfer!</p>

        <p><strong>Program</strong></p>

        <p>18:00 Doors open üçª + üçï</p>
        <p>19:00 Pauline Vos</p>
        <p>19:30 Break</p>
        <p>20:00 Ivan Zarea</p>
        <p>20:30-21:30 Networking and drinks</p>

        <p><strong>Talks</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Pauline Vos</strong> (<a href="https://www.twitter.com/vanamerongen" target="_blank">@vanamerongen</a>) - Git Legit</p>
        <p>Pauline is a software engineer at Werkspot in Amsterdam. If you're fighting with Git on a regular basis, you might not be using it optimally. Pauline will share some hands-on experience that will make your day-to-day life as a Git user easier. You'll learn how to keep your history clean through atomic commits and interactive rebase options, how to easily pinpoint a certain time in your history using bisect, and more.</p>

        <p><strong>Ivan Zarea</strong> - The üëç: there and back again</p>
        <p>Ivan is a Lead Architect at Young Capital. A creator of Pubquizzes, Ivan has volunteered to do a hyperactive interactive talk about the journey of an HTTP request from your browser to your Rails app and back again. You probably know _some_ of the individual pieces, but we'll put them together, covering things like DNS, SSL, nginx, Puma, Rails routing and a bit of the database layer.</p>

        <p>See you there &amp; bring a colleague! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

        <p>Arno, Floor, Tom &amp; Rayta</p>
