<h3> Speaker sponsor</h3>

As a Speaker sponsor you help us include international and diverse talent in our line-up, by covering their airfare and accommodation. Depending on the individual we try and make their stay as valuable as possible to both them and the community. Thus, if we do workshops with the individual, you indirectly support this as well, and you’ll be mentioned as a supporter. Speaker sponsoring is valued at €1200 (excluding VAT).
