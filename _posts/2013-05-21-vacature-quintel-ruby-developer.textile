WE ARE LOOKING FOR A DEVELOPER THAT:
- likes to think out of the box and invent new solutions
- is always looking to improve an existing code base
- has a bit of OCD for code quality
- prefers to re-use then to program
- can switch from big picture to implementation details
- can switch between working independently and together in a team
- works (or wants to learn how to) test driven, or 'documentation driven'

CODE BASE
Our codebase has something for everyone. 30% hardcore Ruby, 30% Javascript, (backbone.js, CoffeeScript, Meteor.js etc) 30% Rails and 10% other code. We have DSLs (for our non-programmers), API, fast EC2 instances for calculations.

THINGS WE DID BEFORE
- Git as a database
- Open source projects, such as our graph library.
- Custom graph query language to extract data from the model
- Massive processing within a rails request (think thousands of ruby objects
  calculating energy flows)
- Visualizations with D3.
- ...much more!

LOCATION
You live in (ordered by preference): Netherlands, Europe, World. You are ready to move to Amsterdam and work from our offices in the center of Amsterdam.
