WE ARE LOOKING FOR A DEVELOPER WHO:
- likes out-of-the-box thinking and inventing new solutions;
- is always looking to improve an existing code base;
- has a bit of OCD for code quality;
- prefers to re-use rather than to program;
- can switch from big picture to implementation details;
- can switch between working independently to a team;
- works (or wants to learn how to be) test driven, or ‘documentation driven’;

CODE BASE
Our codebase has something for everyone: 30% hardcore Ruby, 30% Javascript, (backbone.js, CoffeeScript, Meteor.js, etc.) 30% Rails and 10% other code. We have DSLs (for our non-programmers), APIs, and fast EC2 instances for calculations.

THINGS WE HAVE DONE
- Git as a database;
- Open source projects, such as our graph library;
- Custom graph query language to extract data from the model;
- Massive processing within a Rails request (think thousands of Ruby objects
calculating energy flows);
- Visualizations with D3;
- …much more!

LOCATION
You live in (ordered by preference): Netherlands, Europe, World. You are ready to move to Amsterdam and work from our offices in the center.
